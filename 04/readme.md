# Fourth Tutorial Session
Date: 24 Nov 2025

## Sheet and Solution
- You can find the provided assignment sheet in `sheet04.pdf`
- You can find the provided master solution in `solution04.pdf`

## Minimax and Alpha-Beta
["MinMax_AlphaBeta.ipynb"](./MinMax_AlphaBeta.ipynb) is an implementation of minimax and alpha-beta pruning to solve the game tree presented in the sheet (and some follow-up questions)

## TicTacToe
- ["tictactoe/TicTacToe_MinMax.pdf"](./tictactoe/TicTacToe_MinMax.pdf) is a simple trace of minimax search for tic-tac-toe game.
- ["tictactoe/tictactoe.py"](./tictactoe/tictactoe.py) is a python script to play tic-tac-toe against an agent that uses Alpha-Beta Pruning.
    - download it and run it with `python PATH_TO_PY_FILE` (try to beat it :D) 

## Nim Game
- ["nim/nim_MinMax.pdf"](./nim/nim_MinMax.pdf) is a simple trace of minimax search for the nim game described in the sheet
- ["nim/nimgame.py"](./nim/nimgame.py) is a python script to play nim (but using the trick to win not using minimax)
